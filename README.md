## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first design

### What I learned

- A quick project where I had fun getting more reps in building from a design spec.

- I had a but of trouble getting the hover effects to match the design brief. After some googling I discovered that it's possible to add selectors after the `:hover` pseudo selector in order to be more specific with the properties I wished to change

```
.pic-wrapper:hover .eye-icon {
  z-index: 5;
}
```
